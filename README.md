# Assignment 2: Machine Learning Using Trees
In this assignment, I will classify customer groups into segments (conduct customer segmentation) by fitting tree models, using the [DecisionTreeClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), and [AdaBoostClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier.html) methods within the sci-kit-learn library, and the [XGBClassifier method](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python/python_api.html#xgboost.XGBClassifier) within the XGBoost package.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation/data) and was initially created for a data science hackathon hosted by [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/). There are 2 datasets, split into a training dataset and test dataset. I will be using the training dataset with 8068 observations and 11 variables.
